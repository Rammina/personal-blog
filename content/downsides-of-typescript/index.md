I love **Typescript** and enjoy using it. However, it’s not perfect and has its downsides.

Some downsides of **Typescript** (based on my experiences and what others have shared):

\-another thing to learn  
\- more code boilerplate, especially for 3rd party libraries (glares at Redux)  
\- installation costs initial time (but it makes up for it later with the type safety)  
\- npm modules without typedef are difficult to work with TS  
\- it only starts to pay off once your codebase gets larger and complex   
\- the resources are scattered in multiple places (no universal, comprehensive resource like MDN; I find the **Typescript** handbook lacking)  
\- slower compile/build time

I most likely will use **Typescript** for most of my projects from here on, unless a third-party library has no type definitions or doesn’t work well with it.
