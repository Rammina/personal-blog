Greetings! I hope everyone is doing well.

Today was a rather “normal” day. I updated my [my User Stories guide](https://dev.to/rammina/the-art-of-writing-agile-user-stories-17o9) like I promised yesterday. I did a lot of networking today, reaching out to people in various social media. Facebook is something I’ve been procrastinating for a while now, I don’t know why I keep avoiding that platform. Maybe the culture is just not a good match for me?

Anyway, moving on to my daily report!

### Yesterday

I read about _the 3C of User Stories_, edited my guide, and did more practice quizzes on Scrum.

### Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Scrum

-   updated [my User Stories guide](https://dev.to/rammina/the-art-of-writing-agile-user-stories-17o9) and added a “3C of User Stories” section.
-   read more about how [not everything has to be a user story](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/not-everything-needs-to-be-a-user-story-using-fdd-features).
-   there are cases in which user stories are not necessary, like internal company projects, projects for technical people, and personal projects.
-   When a Sprint is cancelled:
-   any completed and “Done” Product Backlog items are reviewed.
-   if part of the work is potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts it.
-   all incomplete Product Backlog Items are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog.
-   the three pillars that uphold Scrum are:
-   transparency
-   inspection
-   adaptation
-   did some practice flashcards for Scrum.

Thank you once again for everyone’s support! I wish you all the best, and have a good day.
