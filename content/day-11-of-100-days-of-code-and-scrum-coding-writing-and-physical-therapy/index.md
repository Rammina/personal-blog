Greetings, everyone!

It’s Tuesday, and it’s unfortunate that I won’t be able to be as productive today because of my weekly physical therapy session. That said, I shall try my best to fulfill the minimum requirements of the challenge!

### Yesterday

I finished the draft of the introduction of my Scrum Guide for beginners.

### Today

### Scrum

-   wrote about how the members of a Scrum Team function individually as well as their interactions with the others (still missing the Scrum Master section).
-   read about traits that make an individual suitable for each role in a Scrum Team.
-   looked into how businesses misuse Agile and Scrum in their operations.

### GraphQL

-   review concepts I’ve learned last week.
-   look deeper into how GraphQL differs from REST API, and which scenarios one should be used over the other.

Have a good day everyone!
