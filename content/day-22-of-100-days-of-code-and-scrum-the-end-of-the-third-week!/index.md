It’s finally the weekend, everyone!

Today marks the end of the third week, and so I will be doing a Sprint Review and Retrospective as I mentioned back then, [at the beginning of this challenge](https://dev.to/rammina/100-days-of-code-and-scrum-a-new-challenge-24lp).

### My Previous Weekly Sprint Goals

For reference, here were the Sprint Goals for this week:

### Weekly Sprint Goals

-   focus on diving deeper into **Scrum** principles
-   study for Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification
-   finish my guides about Scrum
-   continue networking
-   if I have extra time, learn about Next.js to prepare for coding my business website
-   no interviews

…I don’t think I’ve finished my guides about Scrum. But let’s see!

### Weekly Review

I’ve finished around 70% of my Sprint Goals for this week…

In any case, here’re the things I’ve accomplished:

### Weekly Retrospective

Moving on, let’s tackle what I’ve managed to do well, what my shortcomings are, and what I could do better next time.

### What Went Great

-   \- finished my first guide, [“The Art of Writing Agile User Stories”](https://dev.to/rammina/the-art-of-writing-agile-user-stories-17o9).
-   met my learning goals for **Scrum**, finishing the practice quizzes.
-   finally started on Next.js.
-   reached out to multiple people on different platforms.

### Some Mistakes I’ve Made

-   I spread myself too thin; I need to spend less time on social media.
-   I couldn’t finish my _Introduction to Scrum_ guide.
-   I should have coded more, and spent less time on networking.
-   AGAIN, forgot to install a website blocker to stop myself from checking off-topic content.

### Things I Could Improve On

-   constantly remind myself that I’m a developer first and foremost.
-   spend more time coding and less time on other things.
-   I should DEFINITELY install something that blocks me from checking certain sites at a specific time.
-   DEFINITELY check emails, social media, and blog on a set schedule instead.
-   prioritize tasks that are more likely to help me meet my weekly goals.

### Third Week is Over: It’s Almost a Month

While the third week wasn’t as stressful as the second one, I will admit I was very much scattered this week.

My goals still pointed me to the right direction, despite my reduced productivity. I do believe the challenge is really helping me, because I would have done nothing on certain days if the rules weren’t in place. It also forced me to keep going even when things were getting boring or draining. Looking back, I’m grateful that the challenge has allowed me to create tangible output on top of learning things.

Thanks to everyone who supported me and interacted with me during the past weeks!

Good luck on your developer journeys, and I wish you all success. Have a great weekend, everyone!
