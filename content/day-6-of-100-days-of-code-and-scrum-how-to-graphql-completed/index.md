Good morning, everyone!

Today was a rather productive day!

I got a lot of networking done for various services, I met both of my GraphQL coding and Scrum studying goals, and I managed to work on my company logo.

I’m starting to get a better hang of balancing coding, studying, and networking. I checked my emails less, and I don’t feel as forced to check all notifications on social media. Focusing on one thing at a time is just crucial for productivity.

### Yesterday

I learned about `setContext` and `ApolloClient`'s caching methods such as `readQuery` and `writeQuery`.

### Today

Here are some of the things I’ve learned:

### GraphQL

-   `useLazyQuery` is a version of `useQuery` that needs to be manually executed for it to retrieve data from the server
-   `useQuery`, on the other hand, runs automatically when the component mounts
-   GraphQL `subscriptions` allows the server to automatically send data to the client side when triggered by a specific event
-   with GraphQL `subscriptions`, the client and server have a steady connection instead of following a typical request-and-response cycle
-   GraphQL `subscriptions` use `WebSocketLink` which uses a WebSocket connection instead of HTTP (which queries and mutations use).

I managed to finish the React + Apollo client tutorial at [https://www.howtographql.com/](https://www.howtographql.com/). It was a pretty useful resource and tutorial.

However, I still think I have a lot of gaps in my knowledge and I can’t reliably use the hooks, functions and other concepts yet. I should probably build a project on my own that uses GraphQL, which is most likely going to help me cement my knowledge.

### Scrum

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:

-   Inspect how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools.
-   Identify and order the major items that went well and potential improvements
-   Create a plan for implementing improvements to the way the Scrum Team does its work.

### Resources/Recommended Readings
