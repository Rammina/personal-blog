Good day, everyone!

My physical therapy session got rescheduled to today, so I couldn’t be as productive. However, I did find this really nice resource for Scrum!

I found these [Scrum Comics](https://seattlescrum.com/downloads/Why-Scrum-Isnt-Making-Your-Company-Very-Agile-v2.pdf) talking about how pretending to follow Scrum is not going to make a company Agile. It was really an interesting read, and I learned a lot about common mistakes of Product Owner role assignment as well as inefficient structures of larger companies that failed to implement Scrum.

Anyway, moving on to my daily report!

### Yesterday

I learned about case scenarios user stories are not suitable for. I also reviewed about what happens when a Sprint is canceled as well as the three pillars of Scrum.

### Today

Here are the things I learned and worked on today:

### Scrum

-   I read [Why Scrum Isn’t Making Your Company Very Agile](https://seattlescrum.com/downloads/Why-Scrum-Isnt-Making-Your-Company-Very-Agile-v2.pdf).
-   a Product Owner is different from a “Team Output Owner.”
-   a Product Owner should be more like an entrepreneur that is focused on business objectives rather than just one team’s objectives.
-   it is best for businesses to only have one Product Owner for a product so that the PO has authority over the entire Product Backlog.
-   a single Product Owner also increases the transparency of the Product Backlog and promotes empiricism.
-   in larger businesses that are not Agile, developer teams are not in touch with clients.
-   finished my practice flashcards for Scrum (need to switch to another resource).

I wish everyone the best!
