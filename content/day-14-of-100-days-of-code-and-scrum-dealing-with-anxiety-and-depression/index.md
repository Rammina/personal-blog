Hello there, everyone!

Today, I took a break from coding and learning Scrum. I simply did 2 hours of learning for the challenge. After all, I can’t always be working nonstop and I also wanted to spend time with my family. I do care about my work-life balance and I don’t like neglecting my loved ones. If I was asked whether I’d prioritize my profession or my loved ones, I would always go for the latter first.

### Off-topic Vent

Actually, I had to provide emotional comfort for my wife and listen to her. She is suffering from debilitating anxiety and depression, but I still love her and want to be with her. Of course, I empathize with her because I deal with similar problems myself. I’m glad we managed to resolve this for today.

Anyway, moving on to the meat of the challenge.

### Yesterday

I finished the draft of the `Product Backlog` and `Sprint Backlog` section and did some practice questions for Scrum.

### Today

Here are the things I’ve learned and done today:

### Scrum

-   did practice quiz questions about Scrum.
-   took a break from writing the guide.

### GraphQL

-   I learned about Build-time Schema Validation & Optimizations in GraphQL.
-   GraphQL apparently lets you have UI code and data requirements side-by-side.
-   GraphQL server lets you send batched requests and batched resolvers.

I hope you don’t give up even when times are challenging.   
 Thank you for reading!
