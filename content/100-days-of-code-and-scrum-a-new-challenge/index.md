I’ve been contemplating doing this for a while now, but I finally decided to start a 100 days of code challenge, but with a twist: I need to learn Scrum as well!

### So what are the rules?

[https://www.100daysofcode.com/](https://www.100daysofcode.com/)

I’m following the same rules like the one from that website, but with additional conditions:

-   I also need to learn Scrum every day.
-   I have to post daily standups/Scrum to keep track of my daily progress and learnings, as well as any impediments/struggles.
-   Every start of the week, I must declare my **Sprint Goal(s)**
-   Every end of the week, I need to post a weekly **Sprint Retrospective** discussing:
-   things I’ve accomplished
-   my learnings
-   mistakes I’ve made
-   actions for improvement in the future
-   I would have to summarize what happened in the 100 days of the challenge after I’ve finished it, most likely in a detailed blog post.

### You keep saying “Scrum.” What is that?

**Scrum** is a _software development methodology/management framework_ typically used by development teams.

It is lightweight, and assists people, teams and organizations produce value by using adaptive solutions for complex problems.

Here is a good introduction to Agile and Scrum by [Jim Medlock of Chingu](https://medium.com/chingu/a-short-introduction-to-the-scrum-methodology-7a23431b9f17). I recommend giving that a read.

### Why am I including Scrum?

-   I’m studying for the **Professional Scrum Master I** (PSM I) certification, so I may as well kill two birds with one stone.
-   Scrum is a highly adaptive, focused management framework that emphasizes delivering results and using feedback to improve something.
-   Scrum’s core values of _commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect_ align well with the 100daysofcode challenge and my own philosophies.
-   Based on my experience, it’s _more motivating to code or work when I follow a software development methodology/management framework_.

### Daily Standup Format

To make things simpler for me, I’m going to write a post every day following this format:

```
Yesterday, I... 
Today, I... 
I'm having a difficulty with...
```

This follows the daily standup (Daily Scrum) format that a Scrum team would do every day.

### Closing Remarks

I’m looking forward to the challenge of committing to this learning/self-improvement plan. I hope the experiences I share with all of you are helpful and insightful.

Anyone is encouraged to join me anytime in this learning journey. I’m eager to make friends with other developers and to expand my network. Feel free to comment and/or DM me if you’d like!
