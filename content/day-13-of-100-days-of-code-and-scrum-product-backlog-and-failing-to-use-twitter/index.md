Hello there, everyone!

I made a lot of progress with Scrum today, and I think Iâ€™m probably mostly familiar with all of the concepts I need to learn for the Professional Scrum Master I (PSM I) certification. Not much GraphQL though.

Oh, and it was also my first time [using Twitter](https://twitter.com/RamminaR), and IÂ   
Â had no idea what to do. ðŸ˜“ I havenâ€™t really used social media that much in my life.

### Yesterday

I finished the draft of the Scrum Master subsection and the Scrum Artifacts of my Scrum Guide for beginners, did some practice questions for Scrum.

### Today

### Scrum

-   added a `Product Backlog` section for my Scrum Guide.
-   added a `Sprint Backlog` section for my Scrum Guide.
-   did a lot of practice quiz questions about Scrum (spent like a few hours on them).

### GraphQL

-   continued learning about GraphQL server-side.
-   read more about `resolver functions`.
-   learned more about the `info` argument in GraphQL resolvers.
-   review concepts Iâ€™ve learned last week.

I wish everyone a great Thursday! Thank you for reading!
